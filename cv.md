## Why programming?
To be honest i didn't like computer classes at school because of \
strickt teacher and outdated studying program (*pascal ABC* was so boring for me),\
but what concerns compeauter games... I coul'd spend hours playing Lineage 2 and\
other games, but hardly wanted i to connect my life with IT technologys then.\
Everything changed when I tried to figure out how does the process of creating\
websites and apps look, and when I saw thousands of code strings this shocked me.\
But not scared, so I plunged into studying...\
These are some of my skills (now it's only at the beggining level but I'm doing\
my best to self-improve):\
* CSS
* JavaScript
* HTML
